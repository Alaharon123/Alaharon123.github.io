# Spring 2011 CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Brian Harvey)

Spring 2011 is the last semester that Brian Harvey taught CS61A at Berkeley.
After he left, they switched from teaching [SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) in Scheme,
the language in which it was written, to teaching Composing Programs, a book based on SICP, but in Python.
The lectures for Spring 2011 are archived on archive.org, and there is a course site as well, but everything is rather scattered.
This website is an attempt to make the course easy to follow. A homepage for the already existing content.
