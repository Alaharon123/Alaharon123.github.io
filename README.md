# Spring 2011 CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Brian Harvey)

Spring 2011 is the last semester that Brian Harvey taught CS61A at Berkeley. After he left,
they switched from teaching [SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) in LISP,
like it was written, to teaching Composing Programs, a book based on SICP, but in Python.
You can read what he had to say about SICP at https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html
The lectures for Spring 2011 are archived on archive.org,
and there is a [course site](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/) as well,
but everything is rather scattered. This website is an attempt to make the course easy to follow.
An organized homepage for the already existing content.

Prequisite: Enough programming that you are familiar with recursion.
If not, do [Simply Scheme](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html) first, or as a corequisite.
[Lab 1 here](/labs/1-1.md) will set you up with the environment needed for it.

Corequisite: Calculus 1
