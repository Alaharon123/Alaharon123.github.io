1. Download and install [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).
   This includes an IDE called DrRacket, which is what you will use throughout this course.
3. Open DrRacket. You can see DrRacket has two text windows.
    * The top one is the definitions area.
      This is what you'll use to write code that you want to save in a file.
    * The bottom one is the interactions area.
      This is what you'll use to try things out, and get results from running files.
4. In the menu bar, go to Language > Choose Language..., select The Racket Language, and press OK
5. In the definitions area, type `#lang simply-scheme`, press the run button on the top right,
   and follow the prompts in the interactions area to install the simply-scheme package.
7. Press run again and you will see the interface you'll be using throughout the course.
   In the interactions area, there should be a `>` with a blinking cursor after it.
   Make sure the top line on any file is always `#lang simply-scheme` for this course

That was probably more handholdy than it needed to be,
but I'll generally get out of your hair and just link the stuff for you to do. Time to do lab 1!
Link is below, but skip step one, that's equivalent to what you've done above,
do step two in the interactions area,
step three in the definitions area (note that they have `\``s where there should be `'`s),
run it, and try `(pigl 'scheme)` in the interactions area. Try running it with other words too!
Try to read the code! Don't worry if you're having trouble with this lab, it'll be covered in lecture 1 as well.
